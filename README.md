PhysiAI

A mobile application for personalized AI-based fitness and nutrition coaching.

The Problem

Many individuals struggle to achieve consistent progress in their fitness journeys because traditional workout and nutrition apps fail to adapt to their unique bodies.
Most apps provide one-size-fits-all plans that don’t consider personal differences in metabolism, recovery rate, and response to specific foods.
As a result, users often lose motivation, follow ineffective routines, and fail to see sustainable results.

Our Solution

PhysiAI introduces an intelligent, fully personalized mobile fitness platform that uses real body measurements to create adaptive training and meal programs.
The system learns from user progress every 2–4 weeks and automatically updates workouts or diet plans — acting as a digital personal trainer and nutritionist combined.
It continuously analyzes the user’s progress and automatically adjusts their plan.

By integrating measurement-based personalization, AI-driven updates, and offline accessibility, PhysiAI creates a powerful ecosystem for anyone who wants to take control of their health and fitness journey.
