## 🩺 The Problem

Many individuals struggle to achieve consistent progress in their fitness journeys because traditional workout and nutrition apps fail to adapt to their unique bodies.  
Most apps provide one-size-fits-all plans that don’t consider personal differences in metabolism, recovery rate, and response to specific foods.  
As a result, users often lose motivation, follow ineffective routines, and fail to see sustainable results.
