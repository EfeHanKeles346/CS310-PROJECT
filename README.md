# 🧠 FitMind

A mobile application for personalized, offline fitness and nutrition tracking based on real body measurements.

---

## 🩺 The Problem

Most fitness and nutrition apps provide one-size-fits-all plans that ignore personal differences such as metabolism, recovery rate, and lifestyle.  
As a result, users struggle to stay consistent and often fail to see real progress.

---

## 💡 Our Solution

**FitMind** creates a truly personalized experience by using real body measurement data (from gyms or dietitians) to build custom workout and meal plans.  
Every 2–4 weeks, the system checks user progress and updates their plan accordingly — all without requiring an internet connection.  
This allows users to track fitness, nutrition, and body composition in one private, adaptive environment.
