## ⚙️ What PhysiAI Does

### 🧍 Measurement-Based Personalization
- Start by uploading your **body measurement report** (from MACFit, a dietitian, or any scanner).  
- PhysiAI builds your **digital body profile** — analyzing your muscle, fat, and proportions.  
- This profile becomes the base for your **individual training and meal plan**.

---

### 🧠 AI Adaptive Training
- PhysiAI continuously learns from your updates.  
- Every 2–4 weeks, it analyzes your progress and **automatically changes your program** if your body isn’t responding.  
- Example: If rice doesn’t help you lose weight, the system switches to a bulgur wheat-based diet plan.  
- The app acts as a **real coach** that adapts training and nutrition for your unique body response.

### 🍳 Advanced Calorie & Meal Tracker
- Select your foods manually — **no photo or barcode scanning**.  
- Choose from a **large database** built from nutritionist data, verified internet sources, and user input.  
- Each item shows **average calories**, **protein**, **carbs**, and **fat**.  
- You can:
  - Add your own foods.  
  - Modify values anytime.  
  - For example, if you think your egg has 700 kcal — type it, save it, done.  
- PhysiAI tracks total daily intake and automatically adjusts meal recommendations based on your data.

---

### 🗓️ Smart Planner & Lifestyle Integration
- A simple weekly calendar that connects:
  - Meals  
  - Workouts  
  - Sleep  
  - Vitamins & minerals  
- Your habits directly shape your plan.  
  - Poor sleep? → Recovery day added.  
  - High calories + good sleep? → Power workout assigned.  

---

### 📈 Progress Tracking
- Update your measurements weekly or bi-weekly.  
- PhysiAI compares results, updates your **digital body**, and fine-tunes your workout and meal plan.  
- You can literally **see your body’s evolution** on screen.
